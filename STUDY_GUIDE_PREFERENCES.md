# Study Guide Preferences & Design Requests

## User Preferences
*   **Goal:** Transform "walls of text" into interactive, visual, and dynamic learning experiences.
*   **Role:** Act as a "great tutor" — engaging, explaining *why*, and showing *how*.
*   **Visual Style:** Beautiful, modern, polished. Avoid "boring" academic looks.
*   **Interactivity:** High priority. Use animations, diagrams, clickable elements, and simulations.
*   **Content:**
    *   **No Code Diffs:** Do not show code diffs in terminal unless explicitly requested.
    *   **Progress:** Visual progress tracking (already implemented, keep enhancing).
    *   **Gamification:** Use game-like elements where appropriate.

## Specific Requests for Week 2 Redesign
*   **Format:** Web-based study guide (HTML/JS/CSS).
*   **Enhancements:**
    *   **Animations:** For complex biological processes (Sequencing, Synthesis, CRISPR).
    *   **Diagrams:** "Pretty" ones, not standard textbook schematics if possible.
    *   **Infographics:** Visual summaries of key data.
    *   **Timelines:** Interactive history of technologies (e.g., Sequencing history).
    *   **Graphs/Charts:** Color-coded and dynamic.
    *   **Images:** Abundant high-quality images.

## Future Agent Instructions
*   **Systematic Approach:** Always research best-in-class tools before implementation.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain this file and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` to ensure consistency across future modules.
*   **Code Quality:** Use established frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Three.js, D3) rather than reinventing the wheel.
*   **Proactive Asset Sourcing:** Don't wait for the user to provide assets; find placeholders or generate them (or use open-source/creative commons if applicable/safe).
